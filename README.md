==============

Totally and Causally Ordered Group Messenger with a Local Persistent Key-Value Table

•Technologies: Java | Android | Distributed Systems.

•Designed and implemented a Group messenger application using Android and Java Networking that preserves 
  total ordering as well as causal ordering of all messages. 

•Implemented a centralized sequencer to assign totally ordered identifiers to multicast messages so that 
  each process makes the same ordering decision based upon these identifiers.
